                           Currents was born out of a necessity for information.  As technology enhances the sportfishing community has lagged behind with old school traditions and dockside rumors. As fuel prices increase and fish populations decline around the world, making informed decisions on where to fish is paragon for any successful trip.  Captains often have a limited network to share information often by their homeport or geographical location, frequently dealing with hearsay and outdated information. With the investment of boat costs, tackle, fuel and bait arming yourself with the latest trustworthy information is what Currents can do for you.
